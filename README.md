## **DESIGN GOALS.**

The aim was to create a streamlined site with two specific goals in mind. The first goal is purely a cognitive one, encourage users to consider this important topic in todays increasingly online environment. The second goal is entirely a functional and business related one. Namely, use the site design to funnel users towards booking a consultation by enticing and guiding them towards the contact page using visual stimulation and robust, clear and uncluttered site navigation.

## **DESIGN FEATURES.**
* ### **Navigation Bar.**

This has been designed to be clear and efficient. The logo sits to the left and the three nav buttons sit to the right. The active page is underlined to remind the user which page they are currently on. When the cursor is hovered over any nav button the animation highlights it to show that it is being engaged by the user. The animation disengages once the cursor has been moved away. After a page has initially loaded, the skip navigation function can be engaged by pressing the TAB button where it will drop down from the top left of the page in order to assist users navigating the site using their keyboards as the primary input device. The navigation bar functionality and design are the same for each page in order to maintain optimal user engagement.

* ### **Footer.**

The footer has been designed to be informative and simple in it's presentation. It should not detract from the main page content yet provide relevant and helpful information for the user to engage with when required. The business contact location, email address and telephone number are clearly displayed below links to social media icons. The icons are animated when the cursor is hovered above to clearly indicate which icon is being engaged by the user. Each link opens the relevant page in a separate tab. The footer functionality and design are the same for each page in order to maintain optimal user engagement.
