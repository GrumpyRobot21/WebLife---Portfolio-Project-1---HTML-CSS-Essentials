                        While it is not always an easy thing to consider, reviewing and
                        compiling your digital life to plan ahead for when you’re no
                        longer around to access it is crucial to guaranteeing your
                        private information can be conscientiously taken care of. This
                        is a subject that online platforms are increasingly aware of and
                        many now allow you to issue instructions for what should happen
                        in the event of your death. However, depending on the particular
                        platform, both preserving and/or deleting your account are
                        possible, but it does require forethought, and they all have
                        very differing levels of complexity in their approaches.

                        Until recently, our treasured memories and important documents
                        have been traditionally kept as physical objects. e.g. - photo
                        albums, scrapbooks, letters, diaries, contracts, official
                        documentation. Usually all of these physical items would be available to
                        loved ones once we were no longer here. However, since the rise of the
                        internet, especially cloud based storage, everything is now in a
                        digital format. From audio and video files to our huge photo
                        collections, emails, documents, contracts and our social media
                        profiles – none of these are easily accessible by third parties following ones
                        death without legacy planning in advance.
