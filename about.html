                            While it is not always an easy thing to consider, reviewing and
                            compiling your digital life to plan ahead for when you’re no
                            longer around to access it is crucial to guaranteeing your
                            private information can be conscientiously taken care of. This
                            is a subject that online platforms are increasingly aware of and
                            many now allow you to issue instructions for what should happen
                            in the event of your death. However, depending on the particular
                            platform, both preserving and/or deleting your account are
                            possible, but it does require forethought, and they all have
                            very differing levels of complexity in their approaches.

                            Until recently, our treasured memories and important documents
                            have been traditionally kept as physical objects. e.g. - photo
                            albums, scrapbooks, letters, diaries, contracts, official
                            documentation. All of these physical items would be available to
                            loved ones once we were no longer here. Since the rise of the
                            internet, especially cloud based storage, everything is now in a
                            digital format. From audio and video files to our huge photo
                            collections, emails, documents, contracts and our social media
                            profiles – none of these are easily accessible by third parties following ones
                            death without legacy planning in advance.
